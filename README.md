# NODE.JS_Study (Notes-app)

### In this notes-application;
I learned node modules system, NPM, file system, JSON, command line arguments and more.

### Small notes in my learning path;
[process.argv]
Yargs helps you build interactive command line tools by parsing arguments and generating an elegant user interface. The simplest way of retrieving arguments in Node.js is via the process.argv array. 

The first element of the process.argv array will always be a file system path pointing to the node executable. The second element is the name of the JavaScript file that is being executed. The third element is the argument that we will use.
